# Description

This script writes (or "flashes") an SD card for a Raspberry Pi. It includes safety checks so that it can only erase and write to an SD card, not another device on the system. The safety checks are probably of most use to beginners. For more advanced users (like the author) it also has the convenience of flashing directly from the file formats downloadable from raspberrypi.org without extracting a .img file from a zip/gz/xz file.

When reporting a bug, please include the full output using the --verbose option. That will include all of the
program's state information, which will help understand the bigger picture what was happening on your system.
Feel free to remove information you don't want to post in a publicly-visible bug report - though it's helpful
to add "[redacted]" where you removed something so it's clear what happened.

For any SD card reader hardware which piflash fails to recognize (and therefore refuses to write to),
please describe the hardware as best you can including name, product number, bus (USB, PCI, etc),
any known controller chips.

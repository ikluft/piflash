# ABSTRACT: Raspberry Pi SD-flashing script with safety checks to avoid erasing the wrong device

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 exit PiFlash::main;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the top-level command-line processing level of the L<piflash> script to flash an SD card for a Raspberry Pi
single-board computer. The main function serves as an exception catching wrapper which calls the piflash function
to process the command line.

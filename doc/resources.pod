=head2 Where to download Raspberry Pi bootable images

The first place to look for Raspberry Pi bootable images is usually the Raspberry Pi Foundation's download page.
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ .  But they stopped adding new sources long ago. There are more. These OS downloads include SD card images for the Raspberry Pi.

Please suggest (or directly submit edits via pull requests on GitHub) other places to download bootable Raspberry Pi images (SD card files).

This is also the list to watch that PiFlash should be able to recognize the file types available for download here and automatically handle them all. If anything changes in the file formats offered in these downloads, please point it out so PiFlash can be updated to work with it.
